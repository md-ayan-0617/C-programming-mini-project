# Password Lock System in C

## Project Description
This project is a Password Lock System developed using C programming language.
The program allows a user to enter a numeric password with a limited number of attempts.
A for loop is used to control the number of login chances.
If the correct password is entered, the system allows login.
If all attempts are used, the system gets locked.

## Why This Project Is Created
This project is created to understand:
- for loop in C
- if-else conditions
- user input using scanf
- real-life password checking logic

It is useful for college practicals and exams.

## Utility of the Project
- Basic security system example
- Can be used as a login system
- Helps beginners improve logic building
- Useful for understanding attempt-based systems

## Working of the Program
- A fixed numeric password is stored in a variable
- User gets 3 attempts to enter the password
- On each wrong attempt, remaining chances are shown
- On correct password, login is successful
- After all attempts, system gets locked

## Future Scope
- Hide password input
- Store password in a file
- Add username with password
- Improve security level
- Convert into GUI application

## Technology Used
- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC / Turbo C
- Platform: Windows / Linux

## Output

Successful Login:
Enter your password: 4411
Login successful

System Locked:
Enter your password: 1234
Wrong password. Chances left: 0
System locked
